                        Once an order has been placed and payment has been processed, it cannot be cancelled or
                        modified. This policy is in
                        place to streamline our operations and maintain efficiency. Our system is designed to process
                        orders promptly, making it
                        difficult to accommodate cancellations after the order is submitted.
                        If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our
